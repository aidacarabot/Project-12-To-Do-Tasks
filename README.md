# To-Do List App 📝

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List application built with **React** and **React Router**. The app allows users to manage tasks by categorizing them into **Home** and **Completed** views. Users can add, mark as completed, and delete tasks, with smooth visual transitions.

## Features ✨

- ➕ Add new tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed or incomplete
- 🔄 Filter tasks between **Home** and **Completed** views
- 🚀 Use **React Router** for navigation between views
- 👀 Tasks temporarily stay visible for 3 seconds when toggling their status (marking as completed or incomplete)
- 📱 Fully responsive and styled using **CSS Variables**

## Technologies Used 💻

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **React Router**: For routing between views
- **CSS Variables**: For consistent theming and easy style management
- **State Management**: `useState`, `useEffect` hooks for state management


## How It Works 🤔

- The app is divided into two main views: **Home** and **Completed**.
  - **Home** shows tasks that are not yet completed.
  - **Completed** shows tasks that are marked as completed.
- You can navigate between **Home** and **Completed** using the **Navbar**.
- The app is designed to be simple and user-friendly, with smooth transitions when interacting with tasks.
